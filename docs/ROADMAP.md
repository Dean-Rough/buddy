# Platform Evolution Roadmap - Web-First Strategy → Buddy 2.0 → Onda 3.0

## 🌐 WEB-FIRST STRATEGY ANNOUNCEMENT

### Strategic Pivot: Progressive Web App (PWA) Approach

**Why Web-First Wins for Child Safety AI:**

Apple's App Store restrictions prohibit AI-generated content in kids' apps, making a web-first approach not just strategic but necessary. This constraint becomes our competitive advantage:

- **🚀 Instant Updates**: Deploy safety improvements immediately without review delays
- **💰 100% Revenue**: No 30% App Store commission on subscriptions
- **🌍 Universal Access**: Works on all devices with a browser
- **🔒 Better Safety**: Real-time updates for emerging threats
- **📱 App-Like Experience**: PWA technology provides native feel

## 🚀 CURRENT FOCUS (January 2025)

### Immediate Phase: Beta Testing & PWA Enhancement (Q1 2025)

**Platform is LIVE - Focus on user acquisition and PWA features**

- 🎯 **Active Beta Testing**:
  - Platform live at www.onda.click
  - Recruiting 10-20 beta families
  - Monitoring safety calibration
  - Collecting nudging effectiveness feedback
  - Optimizing conversation bridges

- 🎯 **PWA Enhancement** (2-4 weeks):
  - Install to home screen functionality
  - Offline chat capability for started conversations
  - Push notifications (with parental consent)
  - App-like splash screens and icons
  - Service worker implementation

- 🎯 **Marketing & Growth**:
  - "Safer than apps - always updated"
