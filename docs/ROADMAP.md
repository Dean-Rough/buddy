# Platform Evolution Roadmap - Web-First Strategy → Buddy 2.0 → Onda 3.0

## 🌐 WEB-FIRST STRATEGY ANNOUNCEMENT

### Strategic Pivot: Progressive Web App (PWA) Approach

**Why Web-First Wins for Child Safety AI:**

Apple's App Store restrictions prohibit AI-generated content in kids' apps, making a web-first approach not just strategic but necessary. This constraint becomes our competitive advantage:

- **💰 100% Revenue**: No 30% App Store commission on subscriptions
- **🌍 Universal Access**: Works on all devices with a browser
- **🔒 Better Safety**: Real-time updates for emerging threats
- **📱 App-Like Experience**: PWA technology provides native feel

### Immediate Phase: PWA Implementation (2-4 weeks)

**Transform the web app into a premium mobile experience**

- 🎯 **Progressive Web App Features**:

  - Install to home screen functionality
  - Offline chat capability for started conversations
  - Push notifications (with parental consent)
