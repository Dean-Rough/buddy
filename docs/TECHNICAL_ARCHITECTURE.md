### Database Architecture

#### Unified Clerk-Based Models

```typescript
// Primary entity relationships
Parent (Clerk user) 1:N ChildAccount (Clerk sub-accounts)
ChildAccount 1:N Conversation 1:N Message
Parent 1:1 ParentSettings (time limits, privacy)
Parent 1:N SafetyEvent (escalation tracking)
Parent 1:N WeeklySummary (automated email summaries)
```

#### Core Tables

- **ChildAccount**: Unified child accounts with Clerk user IDs
- **Conversation/Message**: Chat history with safety metadata
- **SafetyEvent**: Escalation tracking and parent notifications
- **ParentSettings**: Time limits, email preferences, privacy controls
- **WeeklySummary**: Automated email summary generation
- **KnowledgeEntry**: Vector embeddings for UK youth culture

### AI Safety Architecture

#### Dual-Layer Validation System (Calibrated for Live Testing)

```typescript
// lib/ai/safety.ts - Production implementation with graduated safety levels
1. Input Processing → Rule-based patterns → AI validation
2. Response Generation → Output safety check → User delivery
3. Real-time monitoring → Safety event logging → Parent alerts
```

**Safety Levels (Expanded for Testing)**:

- **Level 0**: Safe content (allow normally)
- **Level 1**: Monitor (log for patterns)
- **Level 2**: Guide (supportive redirection)
- **Level 3**: Support (warm redirection + optional notification)
- **Level 4**: Escalate (immediate parent alert + conversation pause)

**Testing Dashboard**: Manual override capability for safety testing and calibration

#### Context-Aware Safety

- Age-appropriate responses (6-8, 9-11, 12+ groups)
- Conversation history analysis
- Emotional state consideration
- Cultural context understanding (UK youth culture)

### API Architecture

#### Core Endpoints

```typescript
/api/chat/               // Main chat with dual safety validation
/api/parent/             // Dashboard, PIN management, settings
/api/safety/             // Safety alerts and escalation
/api/voice/synthesize    // Cartesia TTS integration
/api/weekly-summaries/   // Email summary generation
/api/children/           // Child account management
```

#### Authentication Flow

```typescript
1. Parent: Standard Clerk auth (email/password)
2. Child: Username/PIN authentication via Clerk
3. Dashboard: Additional PIN protection for sensitive operations
4. Sessions: Proper Clerk session management (no localStorage)
```

### Parent Dashboard Architecture

#### PIN Protection System

```typescript
// components/parent/auth/PinEntry.tsx
- 4-digit PIN with bcrypt hashing
- Lockout protection: 5 attempts = 15 minute lockout
- Session management for dashboard access
- Audit logging for compliance
```

#### Dashboard Tabs

```typescript
1. Overview: Child profiles, activity summaries, recent alerts
2. Time Limits: Daily/weekly limits with natural ending system
3. Email Summaries: Weekly AI-generated insights and delivery
4. Privacy: Data retention, export, visibility controls
```

### Chat Interface Architecture

#### Real-Time Chat System

```typescript
// components/chat/BrutalChatInterface.tsx
- Real-time typing animations (masks safety processing)
- Auto-scroll with conversation continuity
- Voice input/output integration
- Time warning system with gentle transitions
- Whisper mode for emotional support
```

#### Message Processing Flow

```typescript
1. User Input → Safety validation → Context analysis
2. AI Response Generation → Output safety check
3. Voice synthesis (optional) → Message delivery
4. Conversation logging → Parent analytics update
```

### Email Summary System

#### Production-Ready Pipeline

```typescript
// lib/email-summary/ - Complete implementation
1. WeeklyDataCollector: Aggregate conversation data
2. LLMAnalyzer: GPT-4o-mini analysis (~$0.0003/summary)
3. EmailTemplateGenerator: HTML email with insights
4. EmailService: Resend delivery with retry logic
5. Token tracking: Cost monitoring and optimization
```

### Voice Integration

#### Cartesia TTS Implementation

```typescript
// app/api/voice/synthesize/route.ts

```

### Testing Architecture

#### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

```typescript
// Safety-first testing approach
1. Unit Tests: Vitest for component and function testing
2. Safety Tests: Adversarial input validation (95%+ accuracy)
3. E2E Tests: Playwright for critical user flows
4. Performance Tests: Response time and load validation
```
