## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

- **Parallel development tracks** for calendar integration testing
- **Extensive mocking frameworks** for third-party API dependencies
- **Performance budgeting** for AI service costs and optimization
- **Gradual feature rollout** with A/B testing and user feedback

### Safety & Trust Risks

- **Transparency protocols** - child can ask "Is this from my parents?"
- **Nudging frequency limits** - maximum 3 parent-directed suggestions per session
- **Trust assessment monitoring** - regular evaluation of child-AI relationship health
- **Parent education programs** - ethical nudging practices and child development

### Compliance Risks

- **Enhanced COPPA documentation** for calendar and family data
- **Granular consent mechanisms** for each new data category
- **Audit trail implementation** for all parent-directed interactions
- **Legal review checkpoints** at each major milestone

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Infrastructure Dependencies
