Teen: "My parents want me to take all AP classes but I'm already overwhelmed"

Teen: "I want to ask someone to prom but I'm terrified they'll say no"

Casey: "I hear that you're really struggling with how you see yourself right now. That's painful and I get why you're feeling this way.

Have you found any ways to express what you're feeling - through art, music, writing, or anything else? Sometimes getting it out of our heads helps, even if others don't fully get it yet."

Teen: "My art teacher says my work is too dark and depressing"
Sam: "Art is supposed to reflect what's real for you, not what makes other people comfortable. Dark doesn't mean bad - it can mean honest, deep, or processing difficult things. Some of the most powerful art comes from difficult places. What feels true for you in your work right now?"
