# Privacy & Family Model - Onda Teen

_Balancing teen autonomy with family connection and safety oversight_

## Executive Summary

The Onda Teen privacy model fundamentally differs from child-focused platforms by prioritizing teen autonomy while maintaining essential safety nets. This framework provides teens with meaningful privacy control while giving families optional insight and crisis intervention capabilities.

## Core Privacy Principles

### Teen-Centric Design

1. **Privacy by Default**: Conversations are private unless teen chooses to share
2. **Informed Consent**: Clear understanding of what data is collected and why
3. **User Control**: Teens control their data, conversation history, and family sharing
4. **Transparency**: Open communication about safety protocols and when they activate
5. **Minimal Collection**: Only gather data essential for safety and functionality

### Family Connection Framework

- **Opt-in Sharing**: Teens choose what (if anything) to share with family
- **Crisis Override**: Safety emergencies can trigger family notification
- **Graduated Disclosure**: Different levels of information sharing available
- **Relationship Support**: Tools to improve family communication, not surveillance

## Privacy Architecture

### Data Collection Standards

#### What We Collect

**Essential Data (Required)**:

- Age verification (13+ confirmation)
- Basic account information (username, secure authentication)
- Conversation metadata (timestamps, safety scores, crisis flags)
- Safety-relevant content patterns (for crisis detection only)

**Optional Data (User Controlled)**:

- Conversation summaries (for continuity across sessions)
- Mood tracking data (for personalized support)
- Academic or personal goals (for targeted assistance)
- Family sharing preferences and settings

#### What We Don't Collect

**Prohibited Data Collection**:

- Full conversation transcripts (stored locally, encrypted)
- Location data or device tracking
- Social media accounts or external platform integration
- Biometric data or device fingerprinting
- Marketing or advertising profile information

### Data Protection Measures

#### Encryption Standards

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All conversations encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Local Storage Priority**: Sensitive data stored on device when possible
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Onda staff cannot read conversation content
- **Automated Deletion**: Conversations auto-delete based on user preferences

#### Access Controls

- **Teen-Only Access**: Only the teen user can access their conversation history
- **Crisis Exception**: Emergency protocols can access relevant safety information
- **Family Sharing**: Only summary insights shared, never full conversations
- **Professional Referral**: Minimal necessary information for crisis intervention

## Family Connection Models

## Crisis Intervention Protocols

### Privacy Override Conditions

Privacy preferences are overridden only in these specific circumstances:

**Imminent Safety Risk**:

- Active suicidal ideation with means and plan
- Self-harm in progress or immediate risk
- Substance overdose or poisoning
- Abuse disclosure requiring immediate intervention

**Crisis Response Process**:

1. **Immediate Safety**: Connect teen with crisis professional
2. **Consent Attempt**: Ask teen for permission to contact family
3. **Override Justification**: If teen refuses, explain safety necessity
4. **Minimal Disclosure**: Share only safety-relevant information
5. **Follow-up Support**: Continue teen support throughout process

### Crisis Communication Templates

**Family Notification (Emergency Override)**:

```
"This is an automated safety message from Onda Teen. [Teen's name] has shared concerning information that suggests they may be at risk of harm. We have connected them with crisis support services and recommend immediate family involvement.

Please contact [Teen's name] immediately and consider seeking emergency mental health services if needed. A crisis counselor is available at [phone number] for family support.

This notification was sent because safety concerns override normal privacy settings. [Teen's name] will be informed that you have been contacted."
```

**Teen Notification (Privacy Override)**:

```
"I care about your safety, and I'm concerned about what you've shared. I've connected you with a crisis counselor, and I also need to let your family know that you might need extra support right now.

I know this feels like your privacy is being broken, and I understand that's upsetting. This is only happening because your safety is the most important thing. The counselor and I are here to help you through this."
```

## Parental Dashboard Design

### Teen-Approved Insights Only

The parental dashboard shows only information the teen has consented to share:

**Wellbeing Indicators**:

- Mood trends over time (general patterns, not specific conversations)
- Stress level indicators and peak periods
- Topic categories of concern (academic, social, family, identity)
- Support strategies that have been helpful

**Resource Recommendations**:

- Family communication improvement suggestions
- Relevant articles on teen development and mental health
- Local therapy and counseling resource listings
- Crisis intervention information and family support

**Goal Tracking** (if teen opts in):

- Academic goals and progress updates
- Personal development objectives
- Mental health or wellness goals
- Family relationship improvement goals

### Family Communication Tools

**Conversation Starters**:
Based on teen-approved topics, suggest natural conversation openings:

- "Alex mentioned feeling stressed about college applications. You might ask about their timeline and if they need help organizing."
- "The AI noticed Riley has been talking about friend drama. They might appreciate space to share if they want to."

**Resource Sharing**:

- Articles relevant to teen's current challenges
- Family therapy or counseling recommendations
- Support group information for parents of teens
- Mental health crisis resources and planning

## Legal and Compliance Framework

### Age of Consent Considerations

**13+ Digital Consent**:

- Federal COPPA exemption (13+ can consent to data collection)
- State-specific privacy law compliance (California, Virginia, etc.)
- International privacy standard adherence (GDPR for EU users)
- Enhanced protection beyond legal minimums

### Mandatory Reporting Compliance

**Child Abuse Reporting**:

- Clear notification to teen about reporting requirements
- Support throughout reporting process
- Family safety assessment protocols

**Suicide Risk Intervention**:

- Mental health emergency response protocols
- Hospital intervention coordination when necessary
- Family notification for safety planning
- Follow-up care coordination

### Data Retention and Deletion

**User-Controlled Retention**:

- Default: 90-day conversation auto-deletion
- User choice: 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, or manual deletion
- Crisis conversations: Retained for safety follow-up, then deleted
- Family insights: Deleted when teen turns 18 or requests removal

**Right to Deletion**:

- Complete data deletion upon request
- Account closure with full data removal
- Family insight deletion without affecting teen account
- Emergency data preservation only for active safety situations
