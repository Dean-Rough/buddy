# Teen Safety Framework - Onda Teen

_Comprehensive safety protocols for AI companions serving adolescents_

## Executive Summary

Teen safety requirements differ significantly from child safety protocols. While maintaining rigorous protection standards, teen safety must balance autonomy, privacy, and crisis intervention. This framework adapts Onda's proven dual-layer safety architecture for the unique challenges of adolescent mental health and development.

## Teen-Specific Safety Challenges

### Unique Risk Factors

- **Identity formation stress**: Sexual orientation, gender identity exploration
- **Academic pressure**: College prep, GPA anxiety, standardized testing stress
- **Social media dynamics**: Cyberbullying, FOMO, comparison culture
- **Independence development**: Risk-taking behavior, boundary testing
- **Mental health onset**: Depression, anxiety disorders typically emerge in teens

### Privacy vs. Safety Balance

- **Autonomy expectation**: Teens expect privacy rights similar to adults
- **Crisis intervention need**: Still require protection during emergencies
- **Trust building**: Over-surveillance destroys therapeutic relationship
- **Legal complexity**: Varying state laws on teen privacy and mandatory reporting
