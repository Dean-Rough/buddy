see /Users/deannewton/Documents/Buddy/.claude/settings.json

_Safe AI chat companion for children aged 6-12. CRITICAL: All development must prioritize child safety and legal compliance._

## Project Context & Mission

Onda provides AI companionship for children with strict safety, privacy, and compliance requirements. Every feature, every line of code, every decision must pass through the lens of child protection.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.2.29, React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with dual-layer safety validation
- **Database**: NeonDB (PostgreSQL) with Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: Clerk (two-tier: parent accounts + child sub-profiles)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E), custom safety validation
- **AI**: OpenAI/Anthropic via proxy with dual-layer safety architecture
- **Voice**: Cartesia TTS (planned)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with strict environment controls

## Critical Development Commands

```bash
# Development & Build
npm run dev          # Dev server (port 4288, auto-kills existing)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint (must pass before commits)
npm run type-check   # TypeScript validation (must pass)
npm run format       # Prettier formatting

npm run test:e2e     # Playwright E2E tests

# Database (Handle with Care)
npm run db:generate  # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:push      # Push schema to DB (staging only)
npm run db:migrate   # Create migrations (production)
npm run db:seed      # Seed with test data
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio
```

## COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS (Non-Negotiable)

### Legal Framework

- **COPPA**: All child data legally owned by parent accounts
- **GDPR Article 8**: Special protection for children under 16
- **Data Retention**: 90-day maximum, parent-controlled deletion
- **Data Minimization**: No location, device, or biometric collection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Complete activity logs for compliance

### Safety-Critical Architecture

#### Dual-Layer AI Safety System

Every message flows through this architecture:

```
Child Input ‚Üí Safety Monitor ‚Üí Primary Agent ‚Üí Safety Monitor ‚Üí Response
```

**Layer 1**: Primary chat agent (`lib/ai/client.ts`)
**Layer 2**: Real-time safety monitor (`lib/ai/safety.ts`)

#### Two-Tier Authentication Architecture

- **Parent Accounts**: Full Clerk authentication (email/password)
- **Child Sub-Profiles**: PIN-based access (4-digit), stored as sub-accounts
- **Legal Structure**: Child data belongs to parent account (COPPA compliant)

### Safety Severity Levels

- **Level 0**: Safe content - allow normally
- **Level 1**: Monitor - log for pattern analysis
- **Level 2**: Warn - gentle redirection + parent notification
- **Level 3**: Escalate - block conversation + immediate parent alert

## Development Workflow (Safety-First)

### Phase 1: Safety Impact Assessment

Before any feature development:

1. **Privacy Impact Assessment**: What child data is involved?
2. **Age Appropriateness Review**: Suitable for 6-12 year olds?
3. **Parental Control Integration**: Can parents manage this feature?
4. **Compliance Check**: COPPA/GDPR implications?

### Phase 2: Safety-Driven TDD

1. **Safety Tests First**: Write safety validation tests before feature tests
2. **Edge Case Safety**: Test with inappropriate inputs, age boundaries
3. **Escalation Testing**: Verify parent notification workflows
4. **Audit Trail Testing**: Ensure all actions are logged

### Phase 3: Implementation with Safety Gates

1. **No Shortcuts**: Every safety check must be implemented
2. **Real Integrations**: No mocking safety systems
3. **Error Boundaries**: Graceful failure modes for children
4. **Age-Appropriate UX**: Language and design for target age groups

### Phase 4: Compliance Validation

1. **Safety Test Suite**: `npm run test:safety` must pass 100%
2. **Security Scanning**: Automated PII detection validation
3. **Parent Experience Testing**: Verify all parental controls work
4. **Documentation**: Update compliance docs and safety procedures

## File Structure Patterns

### API Routes (`/app/api/`) - Security Critical

- `auth/` - Authentication (PIN verification, child creation)
- `chat/` - Message handling with mandatory safety validation
- `children/` - Child profile management (COPPA compliant)
- `safety/` - Safety monitoring and parent notifications

### Components (`/components/`) - Child-Safe Design

- `auth/` - PIN entry, parent onboarding
- `chat/` - Chat interface with typing animations (masks safety processing)
- `ui/` - Brutal design system (age-appropriate)
- `layout/` - Child-safe navigation

### Libraries (`/lib/`) - Safety Infrastructure

- `ai/` - Dual-layer safety system and AI integration
- `auth.ts` - Authentication utilities
- `prisma.ts` - Database client with child data protection
- `safety/` - Safety validation, content filtering, escalation

## Database Schema (Migration Phase)

### Legacy Models (PIN-based system)

- `Child`, `Conversation`, `Message`

### New Models (Clerk-based system)

- `ChildAccount`, `NewConversation`, `NewMessage`

### Shared Models (Cross-system)

- `Parent`, `SafetyEvent`, `ParentNotification`

**CRITICAL**: Never modify child data without proper parent authentication.

## Child UX Design Principles

### Age-Appropriate Design (6-12 years)

- **Vocabulary Adaptation**: Adjust by age groups (6-8, 9-11, 12+)
- **Emotional Safety**: Error boundaries with comforting messages
- **Visual Feedback**: Typing animations mask safety processing delays
- **Persona System**: Child selects AI companion character
- **Whisper Mode**: Calming interactions for distressed children

### Safety-First Interactions

- **No Personal Questions**: AI should not ask for personal information
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Focus on encouraging, supportive responses
- **Redirect Inappropriate Topics**: Gentle subject changes, not harsh rejections
- **Parent Notifications**: Transparent communication about concerning patterns

## Security Implementation Requirements

### Message Validation Flow (Mandatory)

1. **Input Sanitization**: All messages validated before processing
2. **Rule-Based Checks**: Pattern matching for immediate safety issues
3. **AI Safety Validation**: Context-aware safety analysis
4. **Escalation Logic**: Severity-based parent notification
5. **Response Generation**: Age-appropriate safety responses

### Data Protection Standards

- **PII Detection**: Automated scanning for personal information
- **Content Filtering**: Real-time inappropriate content blocking
- **Audit Logging**: Complete conversation history for compliance
- **Parent Dashboard**: Transparent activity reporting
- **Emergency Escalation**: Direct parent contact for serious concerns

## Restricted Operations (DO NOT)

- ‚ùå Direct database queries on child profiles without parent auth
- ‚ùå Storing conversations longer than 90 days
- ‚ùå Collecting any location or device data
- ‚ùå Allowing anonymous child interactions
- ‚ùå Implementing features without safety tests
- ‚ùå Deploying without parent notification systems

## Testing Strategy (Child Safety Critical)

### Safety Test Requirements

```bash
npm run test:safety  # Must pass 100% before any deployment
```

**Test Coverage Requirements:**

- **100% for safety features**: No exceptions
- **90% for general features**: Standard requirement
- **Edge Case Testing**: Inappropriate inputs, age boundaries
- **Escalation Testing**: Parent notification workflows

### Child Safety Test Scenarios

- Inappropriate language input
- Personal information sharing attempts
- Emotional distress detection
- Age boundary violations
- Parent notification triggers
- Emergency escalation procedures

## Compliance Checklist (Before Any Deployment)

- [ ] All child data operations have parent consent verification
- [ ] Safety monitoring is active for all interactions
- [ ] PII detection and masking is functioning
- [ ] Parent notification systems are working
- [ ] Data retention limits are enforced (90 days)
- [ ] Audit logging captures all required events
- [ ] Age-appropriate design validated across age groups
- [ ] Emergency escalation procedures tested

## Emergency Procedures

If safety concerns arise during development:

1. **Stop Feature Development**: Do not proceed without safety review
2. **Document the Concern**: Record details in safety log
3. **Escalate Immediately**: Contact project lead and safety officer
4. **Implement Additional Safeguards**: Err on side of over-protection
5. **Re-test Thoroughly**: Validate all safety systems before continuing

_Remember: We're building a safe space for children. When in doubt, choose the most protective option._
