# Human-Like Typing Animation Code (TypeScript/React)

This is the TypeScript/React implementation of human-like typing simulation from the Humate project.
Originally based on the typetype jQuery plugin (https://github.com/iamdanfox/typetype).

## Core Algorithm Features:
- Realistic typing errors with backspacing
- Variable typing speed based on character type
- Audio feedback for keystrokes and backspaces
- Punctuation pauses (periods, commas, etc.)
- Character-specific delays and error patterns

## Key Functions:

### useTypetype Hook
Main typing simulation hook with these parameters:
- t: Base interval between keypresses (default: 100ms)
- e: Error rate (default: 0.02)
- callback: Function called when typing complete
- keypress: Function called after each keystroke

### Character Timing Rules:
- Same as previous char: 1.6x delay
- Period/exclamation/question: 12x delay
- Comma/semicolon/colon: 8x delay
- Space: 3x delay
- Regular characters: 2x delay

### Error Simulation Types:
1. Type 4 characters ahead, then backspace (30% chance)
2. Uppercase previous + 4 chars ahead, backspace (70% chance)
3. Type next character instead, backspace (50% chance)
4. Swap current and next character, backspace (100% chance)
5. Type lowercase instead of uppercase, backspace (50% chance)

### Audio Integration:
- Reduced frequency audio (every other keystroke)
- Always plays backspace sounds
- Uses separate audio manager for sound effects

## Usage Example:
```typescript
const { displayText, isTyping, isComplete } = useTypetype(
  "Your message here",
  {
    t: 100,        // 100ms base delay
    e: 0.02,       // 2% error rate
    callback: () => console.log('Done typing!')
  }
);
```

## Component Usage:
```tsx
<AIMessageTyping 
  content="Hello, how are you today?"
  speed="normal"
  onComplete={() => console.log('Finished!')}
  showCursor={true}
/>
```

This creates incredibly realistic human-like typing with natural errors, corrections, and timing variations that make AI responses feel more conversational and human.
