# 🚀 Production Deployment Plan - Buddy AI Platform

**Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**  
**Estimated Time to Production: 8-10 weeks**  
**Critical Blocker: Safety System Failures**

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. **SAFETY SYSTEM FAILURES** (Severity: CRITICAL)
- **6 out of 20 safety tests are failing**
- Self-harm detection: Only 30% accuracy (requires 90% minimum)
- Context-aware detection: Completely broken
- Safety validation fail-safe: Not functioning

**This is a child safety platform - these failures are absolutely unacceptable and deployment must be blocked until fixed.**

### 2. **Security Vulnerabilities** (Severity: HIGH)
- No API rate limiting implemented
- Missing CSRF protection
- No security headers (XSS, clickjacking protection)
- TypeScript errors ignored in build configuration

### 3. **Legal & Compliance Gaps** (Severity: HIGH)
- No Terms of Service
- No Privacy Policy
- No automated data retention (COPPA violation risk)
- No user consent flows

### 4. **Business Infrastructure** (Severity: HIGH)
- No payment processing system
- No customer support infrastructure
- No admin tools for user management
- Missing help documentation
